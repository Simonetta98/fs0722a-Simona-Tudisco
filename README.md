creating solo projects and group projects.
ðŸ”— INSIDE
Every day for every week there are exercises regarding a specific argument.
At the end of every week folder there's usually a bigger project that condense all the skills learned during that week.
Every 4th week there's a group project that sums up the skills learned in that month.
